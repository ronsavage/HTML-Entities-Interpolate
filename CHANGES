	- Original version
	- Source code author: David Nicol
	- I (Ron Savage) am releasing this module, which David emailed to me,
		because it is a pre-requisite for my module DBIx::Admin
	- This module was recently released under the name HTML::Entitize, but
		I've changed this name so it will be found more easily via CPAN searches.
		The name HTML::Entitize was just a bit too obscure for its own good
