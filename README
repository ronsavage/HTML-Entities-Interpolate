README file for HTML::Entities::Interpolate.

Warning: WinZip 8.1 and 9.0 both contain an 'accidental' bug which stops
them recognizing the directory structures of some valid *.tar files.
You are better off using a reliable tool such as InfoZip:
ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/
This bug has something to do with POSIX style paths.

1 Installing from a Unix-like distro
------------------------------------
shell>gunzip HTML-Entities-Interpolate-1.00.tgz
shell>tar mxvf HTML-Entities-Interpolate-1.00.tar

On Unix-like systems:

shell>perl Build.PL
shell>./Build
shell>./Build test
shell>./Build install

On MS Windows-like systems:

shell>perl Build.PL
shell>perl Build
shell>perl Build test
shell>perl Build install

On all systems:

Run Application.pm through you favourite pod2html translator.

If you are using fancy-pom2.pl, with its 'default.css' file installed in
/apache2/htdocs/css/, you'd do:

	shell>perl fancy-pom2.pl html -css Interpolate.pm > /apache2/htdocs/Interpolate.html

	or perhaps something like:

	shell>perl fancy-pom2.pl html -css Interpolate.pm > /perl/html/site/lib/HTML/Entities/Interpolate.html

2 Installing from an ActiveState distro
---------------------------------------
shell>unzip HTML-Entities-Interpolate-1.00.zip
shell>ppm install --location=. HTML-Entities-Interpolate
shell>del HTML-Entities-Interpolate-1.00.ppd
shell>del PPM-HTML-Entities-Interpolate-1.00.tar.gz
