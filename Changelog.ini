- Original version
- Source code author: David Nicol
- I (Ron Savage) am releasing this module which David emailed to me
because it is a pre-requisite for my module DBIx::Admin
- This module was recently released under the name HTML::Entitize but
I've changed this name so it will be found more easily via CPAN searches.
The name HTML::Entitize was just a bit too obscure for its own good
