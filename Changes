Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Entities::Interpolate.

1.05  Tue Jul  9 08:56:00 2013
	- No code changes.
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::SPEC.
	- Recreate META.* files so they say licence is artistic_2 rather than artistic_1.
		Build.PL and Makefile.PL already said artistic_2, but the META.* files didn't.
		There is no reference to licences in the source of the module itself.
		This was requested by Christopher Meng who packages stuff for Fedora.

	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
	- Update MANIFEST.SKIP, MYMETA.json.
	- Add META.json.

1.03  Sun Feb 21 12:55:15 2010

1.00  Wed Nov  9 15:30:45 2004
	- Original version
	- Source code author: David Nicol
	- I (Ron Savage) am releasing this module, which David emailed to me,
		because it is a pre-requisite for my module DBIx::Admin
	- This module was recently released under the name HTML::Entitize, but
		I've changed this name so it will be found more easily via CPAN searches.
		The name HTML::Entitize was just a bit too obscure for its own good
